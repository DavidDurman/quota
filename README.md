## Contributing

To set up your development environment for Quota:

1. Clone this repo to your desktop,
2. in the shell `cd` to the main folder,
3. hit `npm install`,
4. hit `npm install gulp -g` if you haven't installed gulp globally yet, and
5. run `gulp dev`. (Or run `node ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev` if you don't want to install gulp globally.)

`gulp dev` watches all source files and if you save some changes it will lint the code and execute all tests. The test coverage report can be viewed from `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

If you want to debug a test you should use `gulp test-without-coverage` to run all tests without obscuring the code by the test coverage instrumentation.
